https://softuni.bg/trainings/3748/programming-basics-with-python-may-2022

The "Programming Basics" course provides the initial programming skills necessary for all technology majors at Software University. This includes writing programming code at an entry level (basic coding skills), working with a development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input data and printing results), using conditional constructs (if, if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while).

Python Advanced with Python - 01.2023

https://softuni.bg/trainings/3963/python-advanced-january-2023

The Python Advanced course builds on Python language skills by addressing more complex concepts typical of the language. In the course you will learn to create linear data structures, solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with stacks and queues (Stacks & Queues), tuples and sets (Tuples & Sets), matrices (Multidimensional Lists) , as well as files and directories. Attention will be paid to the functional programming paradigm. You will take a deeper look at recursive functions and functions with multiple arguments. The development environment that will be used by the training team is PyCharm, but each trainee is free to use tools of preference.

Python OOP - February 2023

https://softuni.bg/trainings/3964/python-oop-february-2023

The Python OOP course will teach you the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), working with classes and objects, using object-oriented modeling, and building class hierarchies. Basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism will be studied. We will go into the most commonly used design patterns. We will learn what iterators and generators are and how to use them. We will focus on unit testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).
